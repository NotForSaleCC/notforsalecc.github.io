## Welcome to the NotForSale Project
Our project is an open-source, sustainable, and energy-efficient alternative to paper posters, built on the principles of accessibility, transparency, and decentralization.

## How it works
Our project allows people to display any NFT art they own in their Solana wallet using their e-ink display. It uses blockchain technology to ensure the art's provenance, and ownership, allowing people to interact with their art in a new and exciting way. But it's not limited to that. You can always send a direct URL to render any image instead, meaning that you don't have to restrict yourself to any blockchains.

## Benefits
* Low power consumption
* Long lifespan
* Reduced environmental impact

## The Future of Art Posters
We believe that e-ink technology has the potential to revolutionize the way that people interact with art. It allows you to easily manage and display your art collection in a new and exciting way, and it provides a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative to paper posters. By supporting our project, you can help us to showcase the potential of e-ink technology and to build a better future for art.

## Support Our Project
Our project is still in its early stages, and we need your support to continue our work. There are several ways that you can help us:

* You can donate to our project using Github Sponsors or Patreon. Your donations will help us to cover the costs of development and to acquire new displays for testing.
* You can contribute to our project by submitting code, documentation, or ideas on GitHub.
* If you have a spare screen that you'd like to donate, we'd be happy to add support for it in our project. This will help us to improve and expand the capabilities of our project, and it will allow us to showcase the potential of e-ink technology as a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative to paper posters.

Thank you for your support!
